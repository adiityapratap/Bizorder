					<p><strong>Hospital Caterings and The Ministry of Health are working in a close partnership to implement a new Healthy Choices Menu for all of your in-house hospital catering requirements.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Public facilities such as hospitals and health services play an essential leadership role in helping the health workforce and visitors make healthier dietary choices.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>By implementing the Healthy Choices hospitals and health services can contribute to the overall caring for the health to everybody within your hospital.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>We at Hospital Caterings have designed and created a delicious catering menu that will please both in-house staff and external visitors – all while looking after their health.</strong></p>
